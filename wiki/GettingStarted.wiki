= Introduction =

This page contains information about how to obtain the !OpenHandle source code and how to use it once you have obtained it.


= Checking out the source =

The latest version of the !OpenHandle source is kept in the Google Code subversion repository for this project. Details on how to check it out are provided on [http://code.google.com/p/openhandle/source/checkout the source page].

= Compiling the source =

!OpenHandle has a critical dependency on version 6 of the [http://handle.net/client_download.html Handle client for Java] which is not distributed with !OpenHandle. Additionally, !OpenHandle itself uses the software project management tool [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven] to manage build and packaging. Therefore, to build !OpenHandle, you need to complete the following steps:

 # Checkout the latest version of the [http://code.google.com/p/openhandle/source/checkout OpenHandle source code] to your preferred location (this will be the *project home*).
 # If you have not already done so, download and install [http://maven.apache.org/download.html Maven].
 # Download the [http://handle.net/client_download.html Client Library (ver. 6) -- Java version] and unpack the zip file, which contains the file `handle.jar`.
 # At a command prompt, type `mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path-to-handle.jar> -DgroupId=net.handle -DartifactId=handle -Dversion=6 -Dpackaging=jar` to install `handle.jar` to your local Maven repository.
 # You can now build !OpenHandle using [http://maven.apache.org/plugins/index.html the normal Maven targets] by entering them at a command prompt in the *project home* root folder (i.e. the same folder where, once the source has been checked out, you have a file called `pom.xml`). Some examples:
  * `mvn clean` - delete all previously built files
  * `mvn compile` - compile the source
  * `mvn package` - create a war file of the !OpenHandle application which can be deployed in your web app container of choice (e.g. [http://tomcat.apache.org Tomcat] or [http://www.mortbay.org/ Jetty])
  * `mvn jar:jar` - compile the source and create a jar file of the !OpenHandle code
  * `mvn tomcat:run` - run the !OpenHandle web application in an embedded Tomcat server on your local machine
