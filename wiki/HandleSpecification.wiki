#summary Specification for Handle

== Handle Specification ==

There are two sources for the Handle specs: 

  * [http://hdl.handle.net/4263537/4068 RFC 3651] (Nov. '03)
  * [http://handle.net/download.html HANDLE.NET 6.2] (Sep. '07)

The RFC is authoritative but has slipped somewhat with respect to the HANDLE.NET 6.2 Java codebase. The table below attempts to capture some of the disparity between the RFC and the codebase.
