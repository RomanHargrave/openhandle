#summary URI scheme for Handle

== URI Scheme ==

Currently handle is registered as an [http://info-uri.info/ info] URI namespace (see the [http://info-uri.info/registry/OAIHandler?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=reg&identifier=info:hdl/ handle namespace] registration) which means a handle can be cited in URI form as e.g.

    info:hdl/1234/567

This is a temporary measure and uses the [http://info-uri.info/ info] URI scheme as a bootstrapping mechanism.

A native URI scheme for handle should be registered.

Four recent (Feb. '08) posts to the handle-info mailing list are germane:

 * [http://www.handle.net/mail-archive/handle-info/msg00243.html Feb 12]
  ** discusses rationale for embedding URI scheme details into revised RFC 3651, rather than  making a separate RFC
 * [http://www.handle.net/mail-archive/handle-info/msg00244.html Feb 13]
  ** discusses how Handle should mirror HTTP in defining a generic syntax, devoid of application syntax for querystring and/or fragment 
 * [http://www.handle.net/mail-archive/handle-info/msg00245.html Feb 14]
  ** provides a first cut at an ABNF for a generic Handle URI scheme
 * [http://www.handle.net/mail-archive/handle-info/msg00252.html Feb 25]
  ** points to the DNS URI scheme as a possible model for a Handle URI scheme

The first cut ABNF from message #3 is reproduced below. In light of message #4, this might be modified to allow for differentiation between naming and resolution in dealing with naming authority. That is, one might see something more like:

{{{
  hdl:1234/567

  hdl://190.12.34.56/1234/567
}}}

the first form being the handle as name, and the second the handle presented to a specific handle server for resolution.
