#summary URI scheme for Handle

== URI Scheme ==

Currently handle is registered as an [http://info-uri.info/ info] URI namespace (see the [http://info-uri.info/registry/OAIHandler?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=reg&identifier=info:hdl/ handle namespace] registration) which means a handle can be cited in URI form as e.g.

    info:hdl/1234/567

This is a temporary measure and uses the [http://info-uri.info/ info] URI scheme as a bootstrapping mechanism.

A native URI scheme for handle should be registered.
