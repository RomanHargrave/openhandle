#summary Homepage for OpenHandle project wiki
 
OpenHandle is a project to expose Handle records in common text-based serializations to make the data stored within the records more amenable to Web applications.

See http://www.handle.net/ for further information on the Handle System.

An OpenHandle service is a Java servlet-based front-end to the Handle System for exposing records as RDF/XML, RDF/N3, JSON.
