OpenHandle is an open-source community project to expose [http://www.handle.net/ Handle Values] in common text-based serializations to make the data stored within the records more accessible to Web applications. OpenHandle is not a replacement for the [http://www.handle.net/ Handle System], but rather an alternate means to access Handle.

Specifically, OpenHandle is implemented as a Java servlet front-end to the Handle System which exposes records in structured form (see [http://nascent.nature.com/openhandle/handle?&mimetype=text/plain&format=rdf&id=10100/10.1038/nri1842 XML] and [http://nascent.nature.com/openhandle/handle?&mimetype=text/plain&format=json&id=10100/10.1038/nri1842 JSON] examples) and as such makes Handle records readable via a simple web service.
