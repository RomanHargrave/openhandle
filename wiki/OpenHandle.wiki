#summary Homepage for OpenHandle project wiki
 
OpenHandle is a project to expose Handle records in common text-based serializations to make the data stored within the records more accessible to Web applications. Specifically, OpenHandle is a Java servlet-based front-end to the Handle System for exposing records as RDF/XML, RDF/N3, and JSON. 

Topics:

 * OpenHandleSerializations - serializations supported by OpenHandle
 * OpenHandleServices - services delivering OpenHandle
 * OpenHandleParameters - querystring parameters to the service
