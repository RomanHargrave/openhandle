#summary Services for OpenHandle

== OpenHandle Services ==

Should manage OpenHandle services with a handle (obviously). Will aim to register for now under the following handle:

 * hdl:10100/openhandle

At the moment there is only one known OpenHandle service:

 * http:/nascent.nature.com/openhandle/handle?

Would be useful to get another service operational as a fallback.

Another consideration would be to emit an HTTP header from the OpenHandle service which would identify that service as an OpenHandle source. The header can be simply grabbed as:

{{{
% curl -I http://hdl.handle.net/10100/openhandle | grep ...
}}}
